  <p>At the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/index.en.html">28th Chaos Communication Congress</a>
Alexander Klink and Julian WÃ¤lde presented a talk about a very effective Denial Of Service attack which targets all
major web development platforms (PHP, Java, .NET, Python, ...).</p>
<p><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<p>The recording of the presentation can be watched on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Cq3CLI6H8">YouTube</a> and the slides
of the presentation are also available in <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2007_28C3_Effective_DoS_on_web_application_platforms.pdf">PDF format</a></p>
<p>Because the response from vendors was lame, to say the least, I wondered what could be done while the fundamental
problem was being fixed ... or not. In particular the reaction from Oracle was very disappointing.</p>
<p>As most of my customers use a Java platform and several use PHP I was looking for a solution until the vendors fixed
their product.</p>
<p>One customer with several Tomcat web containers, PHP servers and a Python based Plone content management system uses an
Apache reverse proxy to unify all these servers and applications behind their main website URL. This got me thinking
about a solution which leverages this single entry point.</p>
<p>So I set out to write an Apache module which filters attacks against the Java and PHP string hashing algorithms. The
Python server is not that vulnerable because it runs on a 64bit Python engine.</p>
<p>The module is in testing and seems to hold off the attacks pretty good. As soon as I'm sure the module doesn't drop
valid packets I'll upload the code to github.</p>
<p>Just checked the <a href="http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html">oCert site</a>. The page claims some fixes but I
would qualify these updates as workarounds.</p>
